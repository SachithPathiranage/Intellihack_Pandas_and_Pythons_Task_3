To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we begin by designing a straightforward template that guides the base model to adhere to our specified instructions.

MCTS breaks answers into smaller parts, prompting the model to generate tags corresponding to reasoning steps necessary for exploration.

What happens when the value model in MCTS is not fine-tuned well?  
When the value model is not fine-tuned well, it becomes difficult to guide the search process effectively, leading to poor performance.

What impact did the challenges with MCTS have on training?  
The challenges with MCTS led to difficulties in iteratively refining the model, affecting the training process.

DeepSeek-R1 is sensitive to prompts, and few-shot prompting consistently degrades its performance.

What prompting method is recommended for optimal results with DeepSeek-R1?  
It is recommended to directly describe the problem and specify the output format using a zero-shot setting for optimal results.

Why has large-scale RL not been applied extensively in software engineering tasks?  
Due to the long evaluation times, which impact the efficiency of the RL process, large-scale RL has not been applied extensively in software engineering tasks.

How has DeepSeek-R1 performed on software engineering benchmarks?  
DeepSeek-R1 has not demonstrated a huge improvement over DeepSeek-V3 on software engineering benchmarks.

What future improvements are planned to address the efficiency of large-scale RL in software engineering tasks?  
Future versions will address this by implementing rejection sampling on software engineering data or incorporating asynchronous evaluations during the RL process to improve efficiency.

What is the main goal of the future research directions for DeepSeek-R1?  
The future research directions for DeepSeek-R1 focus on improving general capabilities, addressing language mixing issues, optimizing prompting techniques, and enhancing performance in software engineering tasks.
