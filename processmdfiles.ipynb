DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.\n\nIn recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and evolution   , progressively diminishing the gap towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\n\nRecently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline. It has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt to user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against pre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI's o1  series models were the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-of-Thought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various reasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge of effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior works have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models    , reinforcement learning , and search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search    . However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning performance comparable to OpenAI's o1 series models.\n\nIn this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities using pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ GRPO  as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning. During training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance on reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to 71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912.\n\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training pipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1- Zero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains such as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. After fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking into account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to as DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217.\n\n• **Others**: DeepSeek-R1 also excels in a wide range of tasks, including creative writing, general question answering, editing, summarization, and more. It achieves an impressive length-controlled win-rate of 87.6% on AlpacaEval 2.0 and a win-rate of 92.3% on ArenaHard, showcasing its strong ability to intelligently handle non-exam-oriented queries. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates outstanding performance on tasks requiring long-context understanding, substantially outperforming DeepSeek-V3 on long-context benchmarks.\n\nPrevious work has heavily relied on large amounts of supervised data to enhance model performance. In this study, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start. Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with the inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data. In the following sections, we present: (1) DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which applies RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, and (2) DeepSeek-R1, which applies RL starting from a checkpoint fine-tuned with thousands of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples. 3) Distill the reasoning capability from DeepSeek-R1 to small dense models.\n\nReinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as evidenced by our previous works  . However, these works heavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities **without any supervised data**, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a brief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and hope this provides the community with valuable insights.\n\n$$\\begin{split} \\mathcal{J}\\_{GRPO}(\\theta) &= \\mathbb{E}\\left[q \\sim P(Q), \\{o\\_{l}\\}\\_{l=1}^{G} \\sim \\pi\\_{\\theta\\_{old}}(O|q)\\right] \\\\ &\\frac{1}{G} \\sum\\_{i=1}^{G} \\left(\\min\\left(\\frac{\\pi\\_{\\theta}(o\\_{l}|q)}{\\pi\\_{\\theta\\_{old}}(o\\_{l}|q)} A\\_{i\\prime} \\text{clip}\\left(\\frac{\\pi\\_{\\theta}(o\\_{l}|q)}{\\pi\\_{\\theta\\_{old}}(o\\_{l}|q)}, 1-\\varepsilon, 1+\\varepsilon\\right) A\\_{i}\\right) - \\beta \\mathbb{D}\\_{KL}\\left(\\pi\\_{\\theta}(|\\pi\\_{ref}\\rangle)\\right)\\right), \\end{split} \\tag{1}$$\n\n$$\\pi\\_{\\pi^{\\mathsf{uf}}}(o\\_{l}|q) \\qquad \\pi\\_{\\pi^{\\mathsf{uf}}}(o\\_{l}|q)$$\n\n$$\\mathbb{D}\\_{KL}\\left(\\pi\\_{\\theta}||\\pi\\_{ref}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi\\_{ref}(o\\_{i}|q)}{\\pi\\_{\\theta}(o\\_{i}|q)} - \\log \\frac{\\pi\\_{ref}(o\\_{i}|q)}{\\pi\\_{\\theta}(o\\_{i}|q)} - 1,\\tag{2}$$\n\nwhere and are hyper-parameters, and is the advantage, computed using a group of rewards {1,2, . . . ,} corresponding to the outputs within each group:\n\n$$A\\_{\\rm i} = \\frac{r\\_{\\rm i} - \\text{mean}(\\{r\\_1, r\\_2, \\dots, r\\_{\\rm i}\\})}{\\text{std}(\\{r\\_1, r\\_2, \\dots, r\\_G\\})}.\\tag{3}$$\n\nThe reward is the source of the training signal, which decides the optimization direction of RL. To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we adopt a rule-based reward system that mainly consists of two types of rewards:\n\nWe do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero, because we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale reinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline.\n\nTo train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we begin by designing a straightforward template that guides the base model to adhere to our specified instructions. As depicted in Table  this template requires DeepSeek-R1-Zero to first produce a reasoning process, followed by the final answer. We intentionally limit our constraints to this structural format, avoiding any content-specific biases—such as mandating reflective reasoning or promoting particular problem-solving strategies—to ensure that we can accurately observe the model's natural progression during the RL process.\n\nTable  provides a comparative analysis between DeepSeek-R1-Zero and OpenAI's o1-0912 models across a variety of reasoning-related benchmarks. The findings reveal that RL empowers\n\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero to attain robust reasoning capabilities without the need for any supervised fine-tuning data. This is a noteworthy achievement, as it underscores the model's ability to learn and generalize effectively through RL alone. Additionally, the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero can be further augmented through the application of majority voting. For example, when majority voting is employed on the AIME benchmark, DeepSeek-R1-Zero's performance escalates from 71.0% to 86.7%, thereby exceeding the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912. The ability of DeepSeek-R1-Zero to achieve such competitive performance, both with and without majority voting, highlights its strong foundational capabilities and its potential for further advancements in reasoning tasks.\n\nAs depicted in Figure  the thinking time of DeepSeek-R1-Zero shows consistent improve-\n\nment throughout the training process. This improvement is not the result of external adjustments but rather an intrinsic development within the model. DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally acquires the ability to solve increasingly complex reasoning tasks by leveraging extended test-time computation. This computation ranges from generating hundreds to thousands of reasoning tokens, allowing the model to explore and refine its thought processes in greater depth.\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of this self-evolution is the emergence of sophisticated behaviors as the test-time computation increases. Behaviors such as reflection—where the model revisits and reevaluates its previous steps—and the exploration of alternative approaches to problem-solving arise spontaneously. These behaviors are not explicitly programmed but instead emerge as a result of the model's interaction with the reinforcement learning environment. This spontaneous development significantly enhances DeepSeek-R1-Zero's reasoning capabilities, enabling it to tackle more challenging tasks with greater efficiency and accuracy.\n\nThis moment is not only an \"aha moment\" for the model but also for the researchers observing its behavior. It underscores the power and beauty of reinforcement learning: rather than explicitly teaching the model on how to solve a problem, we simply provide it with the right incentives, and it autonomously develops advanced problem-solving strategies. The \"aha moment\" serves as a powerful reminder of the potential of RL to unlock new levels of intelligence in artificial systems, paving the way for more autonomous and adaptive models in the future.\n\nInspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can reasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small amount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that not only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong general capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows.\n\nUnlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from the base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data to fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several approaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting models to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1- Zero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human annotators.\n\nIn this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as the starting point for RL. Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, the advantages of cold start data include:\n\nAfter fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale reinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses on enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such as coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with clear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing, particularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language mixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated as the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show that such alignment results in a slight degradation in the model's performance, this reward aligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of reasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the final reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence on reasoning tasks.\n\nWhen reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which primarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the model's capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we generate the data and fine-tune the model as described below.\n\nWe fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the above curated dataset of about 800k samples.\n\nTo further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement learning stage aimed at improving the model's helpfulness and harmlessness while simultaneously refining its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using a combination of reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we adhere to the methodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the learning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to reward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build upon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and training prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the assessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing interference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire response of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and mitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation process. Ultimately, the integration of reward signals and diverse data distributions enables us to train a model that excels in reasoning while prioritizing helpfulness and harmlessness.\n\nTo equip more efficient smaller models with reasoning capabilities like DeepSeek-R1, we directly fine-tuned open-source models like Qwen  and Llama  using the 800k samples curated with DeepSeek-R1, as detailed in  Our findings indicate that this straightforward distillation method significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of smaller models. The base models we use here are Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen2.5- 14B, Qwen2.5-32B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We select Llama-3.3 because its reasoning capability is slightly better than that of Llama-3.1.\n\nFor distilled models, we apply only SFT and do not include an RL stage, even though incorporating RL could substantially boost model performance. Our primary goal here is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distillation technique, leaving the exploration of the RL stage to the broader research community.\n\n$$\\text{pass@1} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum\\_{i=1}^{k} p\\_{i\\nu}$$\n\nwhere denotes the correctness of the -th response. This method provides more reliable performance estimates. For AIME 2024, we also report consensus (majority vote) results   using 64 samples, denoted as cons@64.\n\nFor education-oriented knowledge benchmarks such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA Diamond, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates superior performance compared to DeepSeek-V3. This improvement is primarily attributed to enhanced accuracy in STEM-related questions, where significant gains are achieved through large-scale reinforcement learning. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 excels on FRAMES, a long-context-dependent QA task, showcasing its strong document analysis capabilities. This highlights the potential of reasoning models in AI-driven search and data analysis tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where OpenAI-o1 surpasses GPT-4o on this benchmark. However, DeepSeek-R1 performs worse than DeepSeek-V3 on the Chinese SimpleQA benchmark, primarily due to its tendency to refuse answering certain queries after safety RL. Without safety RL, DeepSeek-R1 could achieve an accuracy of over 70%.\n\nDeepSeek-R1 also delivers impressive results on IF-Eval, a benchmark designed to assess a model's ability to follow format instructions. These improvements can be linked to the inclusion of instruction-following data during the final stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL training. Furthermore, remarkable performance is observed on AlpacaEval2.0 and ArenaHard, indicating DeepSeek-R1's strengths in writing tasks and open-domain question answering. Its significant outperformance of DeepSeek-V3 underscores the generalization benefits of large-scale RL, which not only boosts reasoning capabilities but also improves performance across diverse domains. Moreover, the summary lengths generated by DeepSeek-R1 are concise, with an average of 689 tokens on ArenaHard and 2,218 characters on AlpacaEval 2.0. This indicates that\n\nDeepSeek-R1 avoids introducing length bias during GPT-based evaluations, further solidifying its robustness across multiple tasks.\n\nOn math tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217, surpassing other models by a large margin. A similar trend is observed on coding algorithm tasks, such as LiveCodeBench and Codeforces, where reasoning-focused models dominate these benchmarks. On engineering-oriented coding tasks, OpenAI-o1-1217 outperforms DeepSeek-R1 on Aider but achieves comparable performance on SWE Verified. We believe the engineering performance of DeepSeek-R1 will improve in the next version, as the amount of related RL training data currently remains very limited.\n\nAs shown in Table  simply distilling DeepSeek-R1's outputs enables the efficient DeepSeek-R1-7B (i.e., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, abbreviated similarly below) to outperform nonreasoning models like GPT-4o-0513 across the board. DeepSeek-R1-14B surpasses QwQ-32B-Preview on all evaluation metrics, while DeepSeek-R1-32B and DeepSeek-R1-70B significantly exceed o1-mini on most benchmarks. These results demonstrate the strong potential of distillation. Additionally, we found that applying RL to these distilled models yields significant further gains. We believe this warrants further exploration and therefore present only the results of the simple SFT-distilled models here.\n\nIn Section  we can see that by distilling DeepSeek-R1, the small model can achieve impressive results. However, there is still one question left: can the model achieve comparable performance through the large-scale RL training discussed in the paper without distillation?\n\nTo answer this question, we conduct large-scale RL training on Qwen-32B-Base using math, code, and STEM data, training for over 10K steps, resulting in DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B. The experimental results, shown in Table  demonstrate that the 32B base model, after large-scale\n\nRL training, achieves performance on par with QwQ-32B-Preview. However, DeepSeek-R1- Distill-Qwen-32B, which is distilled from DeepSeek-R1, performs significantly better than DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across all benchmarks.\n\nTherefore, we can draw two conclusions: First, distilling more powerful models into smaller ones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL mentioned in this paper require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance of distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, advancing beyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and largerscale reinforcement learning.\n\nIn the early stages of developing DeepSeek-R1, we also encountered failures and setbacks along the way. We share our failure experiences here to provide insights, but this does not imply that these approaches are incapable of developing effective reasoning models.\n\nHowever, this approach encounters several challenges when scaling up the training. First, unlike chess, where the search space is relatively well-defined, token generation presents an\n\nexponentially larger search space. To address this, we set a maximum extension limit for each node, but this can lead to the model getting stuck in local optima. Second, the value model directly influences the quality of generation since it guides each step of the search process. Training a fine-grained value model is inherently difficult, which makes it challenging for the model to iteratively improve. While AlphaGo's core success relied on training a value model to progressively enhance its performance, this principle proves difficult to replicate in our setup due to the complexities of token generation.\n\nIn conclusion, while MCTS can improve performance during inference when paired with a pre-trained value model, iteratively boosting model performance through self-search remains a significant challenge.\n\nIn this work, we share our journey in enhancing model reasoning abilities through reinforcement learning. DeepSeek-R1-Zero represents a pure RL approach without relying on cold-start data, achieving strong performance across various tasks. DeepSeek-R1 is more powerful, leveraging cold-start data alongside iterative RL fine-tuning. Ultimately, DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on a range of tasks.\n\nWe further explore distillation the reasoning capability to small dense models. We use DeepSeek-R1 as the teacher model to generate 800K training samples, and fine-tune several small dense models. The results are promising: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B outperforms GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet on math benchmarks with 28.9% on AIME and 83.9% on MATH. Other dense models also achieve impressive results, significantly outperforming other instructiontuned models based on the same underlying checkpoints.\n\nIn the future, we plan to invest in research across the following directions for DeepSeek-R1.\n\nAixin Liu Bing Xue Bingxuan Wang Bochao Wu Bei Feng Chengda Lu Chenggang Zhao Chengqi Deng Chong Ruan Damai Dai Deli Chen Dongjie Ji Erhang Li Fangyun Lin Fucong Dai Fuli Luo\\* Guangbo Hao Guanting Chen Guowei Li H.
